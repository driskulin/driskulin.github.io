-Watching a new show immediately after its release is always a great way to start an AnimeWalker day. This will give you a sense of when the next episode will air and provide you with a recap of the story before you even get started watching.
-If you&rsquo;re looking for something more drawn out, try checking out OVA&rsquo;s or one-shots before getting into the full series. These episodes usually have less action and more atmosphere, which can add to your enjoyment while giving you more closure on the story.</p><h2 id=prof-marc-flash039s-animation-animation-mentor-class-1-basic-foundations>Prof. Marc Flash's Animation: Animation Mentor Class 1 Basic Foundations<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#prof-marc-flash039s-animation-animation-mentor-class-1-basic-foundations>#</a></h2><img loading=lazy src=https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-y4AV006fuQc/WFt0JkFHvBI/AAAAAAAAAdc/BOV31WdP9_4Qx0W_h7XUbAgGGWCW83ZVQCLcB/s320/MarcFlash_c01s02_Pose_sketches.jpg onerror='this.onerror=null,this.src="https://tse4.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.qMq7sfODoPLOL_1XC9ecBwAAAA&pid=15.1"' alt="Prof. Marc Flash's Animation: Animation Mentor Class 1 Basic Foundations"><p><em>Source: marcflash.blogspot.com.tr</em></p><blockquote><p>mentor foundations.</p></blockquote><p>What are the benefits of cool wallpaper?
